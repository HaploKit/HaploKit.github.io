collection: publications
permalink: /publication/06-2022-StrainXpress-paper-title-number-6
excerpt: 'Here, we present StrainXpress, as a comprehensive solution to the problem of strain aware metagenome assembly from next-generation sequencing reads. In experiments, StrainXpress reconstructs strain-specific genomes from metagenomes that involve up to more than 1000 strains, and proves to successfully deal with poorly covered strains. '
