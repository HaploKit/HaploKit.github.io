permalink: /publication/04-2022-01-20-paper-title-number-4
excerpt: 'Here, we present Strainline, a novel approach to assemble viral haplotypes from noisy long reads without a reference genome. Strainline is the first approach to provide strain-resolved, full-length de novo assemblies of viral quasispecies from noisy third-generation sequencing data. Benchmarking on simulated and real datasets of varying complexity and diversity confirm this novelty and demonstrate the superiority of Strainline.'
