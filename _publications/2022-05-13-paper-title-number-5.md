title: "Enhancing long read based strain-aware metagenome assembly"

permalink: /publication/2022-05-13-paper-title-number-5
excerpt: 'Here, we propose MetaBooster and MetaBooster-HiFi, as two pipelines for strain-aware metagenome assembly from PacBio CLR and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing data. Benchmarking experiments on both simulated and real sequencing data demonstrate that either the MetaBooster or the MetaBooster-HiFi pipeline drastically outperforms the state-of-the-art de novo metagenome assemblers, in terms of all relevant metagenome assembly criteria, involving genome fraction, contig length, and error rates.'
