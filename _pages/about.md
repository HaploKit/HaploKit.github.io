I am Xiao Luo (罗宵), a PhD candidate from Bielefeld University. My research interests mainly focus on computational genomics,  microbiome, etc. During my PhD training, I have developed several computational methods and tools for haplotype-aware genome assembly, including diploid assembly (phasebook), viral quasispecies assembly (Strainline), strain-aware metagenome assembly (StrainXpress, MetaBooster/MetaBooster-HiFi). My research findings have been published in mainstream academic journals, such as *Genome Biology, Nucleic Acids Research, Nature Communications, Bioinformatics, Frontiers in Genetics*, etc.
